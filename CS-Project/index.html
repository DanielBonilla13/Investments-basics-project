        <h3>What Is an Investment?</h3>
        <p>The act of putting money or effort into something to make a profit or achieve a result.</p>
        
        <p>An investment is an asset bought by an individual or organization with the expectation that it will generate some future income or profit</p>
        
        <h3>How an investment really works?</h3>

        <p>In the most straightforward sense, investing works when you buy an asset at a low price and sell it at a higher price. This kind of return on your investment called a capital gain. 
            Earning returns by selling assets for a profit or realizing your capital gains—is one way to make money investing.</p>

         <p>In general, any action that is taken in the hopes of raising future revenue can also be considered an investment. For example, when choosing to pursue additional education, the goal is often to increase knowledge and improve skills. The upfront 
            investment of time attending class and money to pay for tuition will hopefully result in increased earnings over the student's career.</p>

            <h3>Types of investment:</h3>
            
            

            <ul>
                <li>Stocks/Equities
                    <p>A share of stock is a piece of ownership of a public or private company. By owning stock, the investor may be entitled to dividend distributions generated from the net profit of the company. 
                        As the company becomes more successful and other investors seek to buy that company's stock, it's value can also appreciate and be sold for capital gains.</p>
                </li>

                <li>Bonds/Fixed-Income Securities
                    <p>A bond is an investment that often demands an upfront investment, then pays a reoccurring amount over the life of the bond. Then, when the bond matures, the investor receives the capital invested into the bond back. Similar to debt, bond investments are a mechanism for certain entities to raise money.
                         Many government entities and companies issue bonds; then, investors can contribute capital to earn a yield.</p>
                </li>

                <li>Index Funds and Mutual Funds
                    <p>Instead of selecting each individual company to invest in, index funds, mutual funds, and other types of funds often aggregate specific investments to craft one investment vehicle. For example, an investor can buy shares of a single mutual fund that holds ownership of small cap, 
                        emerging market companies instead of having to research and select each company on its own.</p>
                </li>

                <li>Real Estate
                    <p>Real estate investments are often broadly defined as investments in physical, tangible spaces that can be utilized. Land can be built on, office buildings can be occupied, warehouses can store inventory, and residential properties can house families. 
                        Real estate investments may encompass acquiring sites, developing sites for specific uses, or purchasing ready-to-occupy operating sites.</p>
                </li>

                <li>Cryptocurrency
                    <p>Cryptocurrency is a blockchain-based currency used to transact or hold digital value. Cryptocurrency companies can issue coins or tokens that may appreciate in value. 
                        These tokens can be used to transact with or pay fees to transact using specific networks.</p>
                </li>

            <h3>Why is important to invest?</h3>
                <p>Investing is an effective way to put your money to work and potentially build wealth. Smart investing may allow your money to outpace inflation and increase in value.
                    The greater growth potential of investing is primarily due to the power of compounding and the risk-return tradeoff.</p>

            <h3>How to start Investing?</h3>
            <p>There are many different avenues one can take when learning how to invest or where to start when putting money aside. 
                Here are some tips for getting started in investing:</p>   

                <ul>
                    <li><b > Do your own research.</b> <p> Common phrase used in the investing industry, it is important for investors to understand the vehicles they are putting their money into. Whether it is a single share of a well-established company or a risky alternative 
                        investment endeavor, investors should do their homework in advance as opposed to relying on third-party (and often biased) advice.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li><b>What you are investing for</b><p>Perhaps you are investing for retirement, or maybe your end goal is to purchase a home or fund your child’s education. Deciding what your end goal is can help you set a realistic timeline for reaching your goal and make it easier to land on how aggressively you should be investing to make those goals a reality
                        
                    </p></li>

                        <li><b>Establish a personal spending plan. </b><p> Before investing, individuals should consider their ability to put money away. This includes ensuring they have enough capital to pay monthly expenses and have already built 
                            up an emergency fund.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li><b>Understand liquidity restrictions.</b> <p>Some investors may be less liquid than others, meaning it may be more difficult to sell. In some cases, an investment may be locked for a certain period and cannot be liquidated. Though not necessary fine print, it's important to understand whether certain investments
                             can be bought or sold at any time.</p>
                            </li>

                            <li><b>Research tax implications.</b><p> On a similar note, though an investment can be bought or sold at any time, it may be tax-adverse to do so. With unfavorable short-term capital gains tax rates, investors should be mindful of strategies that extend beyond what product they hold but what 
                                tax vehicle they put that investment in.</p>
                            </li>

                            <li><b>Gauge your risk preference. </b><p> As mentioned earlier, investing incurs risk. This means you may end up with less money than what you started with. Investors uncomfortable with this idea can (1) reduce the amount they invest to only what they are comfortable losing or (2) explore ways to mitigate risk.
                            </p>
                           </li>

                           <li><b>Consult an adviser.</b><p> Many financial professionals would be happy to provide their guidance, let you know what they think about markets, and give you access to online platforms 
                            where you can invest money.</p>
                           </li>
