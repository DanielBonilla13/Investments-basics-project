        <h2>How Much Money Do You Need to Start Investing</h2>

        <h3>There’s an old saying, “it takes money to make money.” But no matter how much you have in your bank account, there’s a way to start investing today. 

        </h3>

        <p>Investing is a key money move that can help you achieve your financial goals. So you should try to invest as much as possible, but keep in mind that investing comes with risks.

        </p>

        <p>To figure out that maximum amount for your unique financial situation, you need to make a plan. Most of your budget is likely dedicated to covering basic expenses, like housing, transportation and food—your needs. Another portion goes toward your wants, like hobbies, dining out, going to the movies—the fun stuff. But some of your budget should be allocated toward future goals, like building up an emergency fund, going on a big vacation, buying a home and retiring one day—and that’s where investing comes in.

        </p>

        <H3>BUT FIRST Consider the current state of YOUR finances: </H3>

        <ol>

       <li><P>Your income: Take a close look at your monthly income and consider how much money you have leftover after you’ve covered your non-negotiable expenses. If you’re struggling to make ends meet, you may want to prioritize putting extra funds into an emergency savings account or toward a debt payment. 

       </P></li> 

        <li><p>Your debt balances: Debt, especially high-interest debt, can become very difficult to manage if you don’t have a plan in place to pay those balances down. Take a look at how much you owe and the corresponding interest rates. Determine how much you can comfortably afford to invest, while still making at least the minimum payments on your debts. As you pay down your debt, you can revisit how much you’re investing each month and increase it accordingly. 

        </p></li>

        <li><p>Your emergency savings: According to the latest data from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, 24% of consumers  have no savings set aside for emergencies, and 39 percent have less than a month of income saved for emergencies. Having an emergency fund is crucial if you hope to avoid taking on debt when the unexpected happens. If you’re still working on building up three to six months’ worth of essential expenses, consider investing a smaller amount of your available income while you work to hit that benchmark.  

        </p></li>

    </ol>

        <h3>So how much is that?</h3>

        <p>Only you can determine your actual hard numbers. One budgeting model many experts recommend is the 50-30-20 rule putting 50 percent of your budget toward needs, 30 percent toward wants and 20 percent toward saving and investing for future needs and goals. Of that last 20 percent, consider investing whatever you don't expect to need for at least a few years. That time-frame allows you to take on the risk of short-term losses and ride it out to capture potential long-term gains.

        </p>

        <p>So, if your monthly budget starts with $10,000, that means you should work to set aside $2,000—and depending on your goals, that’s the maximum you’d want to invest.

        </p>

        <p>But one formula doesn’t work for everyone. Especially when you’re just starting out, your entry-level salary may feel like just barely enough to cover the necessities. Don’t sweat it. Just do the best you can, and save whatever amount makes sense for you to start.

        </p>

        <p>How do you figure out how much is right for you? First, you have to get your priorities in order. Beyond covering your needs, identify your goals and decide for yourself what is important to you.

        </p>

        <p>Maybe paying off debts is a top priority. In that case, you want to make a debt-repayment plan, first tackling high-interest-rate debts, like credit-card balances. But then maybe you can prioritize investing for the future ahead of paying off low-interest loans on the books, like student-loan debt or a mortgage, faster. You’d continue to pay down that debt, but invest some of your money at the same time.

        </p>

        <p>Or if establishing an emergency fund is a big goal, you can first shoot to set aside at least $1,000 to start—that’s likely enough to cover a common unexpected expense like a car repair or a minor medical expense. But once you've done that, you could consider slowing down your efforts to fully fund your emergency account (which ideally would hold enough to cover three to six months’ worth of expenses). Then you can redirect some small portion of that savings to investing for the future, even if it’s just $50 or $100 a month.

        </p>
